Yes hello sports fans and welcome to another smooth edition of Java API
unplugged. Meet your new family that won't disappoint you on your birthday:
Lists, Sets and Maps. These bad boys <mark>structure and process collections of
data</mark>. You will definitely want to remember what the do and when to
use them, or at least try to.

- **Lists**: A collection of ordered values
- **Sets**: A collection of non-duplicate values
- **Maps**: A key/value collection

I like you. I made you a little summin' summin' to help you remember:

| Who  | What                                 | When                                                                                    |
|----- |--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List | A collection of values               | You need duplicate values or are managing a small set of data                           |
| Set  | A collection of non-duplicate values | You need duplicate free values, or are managing a large set of data                     |
| Map  | A key/value collection               | You need a key/value store with frequent look-ups or need to make many query operations |
